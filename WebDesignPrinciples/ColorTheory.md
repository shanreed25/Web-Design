# Color Theory
- a framework of principles that helps designers choose and combine colors effectively to create visually appealing, harmonious, and emotionally resonant websites
- involves understanding the relationships between colors on a color wheel (such as analogous and complementary colors), the psychological impact of hues, and how to use color to enhance brand identity, navigation, usability, and accessibility

## Key Concepts in Color Theory for Web Design
- **Color Wheel** central tool that organizes primary, secondary, and tertiary colors and illustrates their relationships. 
- **Color Harmonies** different ways to combine colors for visual appeal:
    - **Analogous colors:** Colors next to each other on the wheel, creating a cohesive look. 
    - **Complementary colors:** Colors opposite each other on the wheel, used for strong contrast and visual impact. 
    - **Monochromatic colors:** Different shades of a single color, providing a minimalist and modern feel. 
    - **Triadic colors:** Three evenly spaced colors on the wheel, used for a vibrant and balanced palette. 
- **Color Psychology** the study of how colors affect human behavior and emotions, helping designers evoke specific feelings (e.g., red for passion, blue for trust). 
- **Color Elements** understanding hue (the color itself), value (lightness or darkness), and saturation (color intensity). 
- **The 60-30-10 Rule** a design guideline where the dominant color makes up 60% of a design, the secondary color takes 30%, and an accent color is used for 10%

# Analogous color palette(not good for standing out)
- consists of three or more colors that are positioned next to each other on the color wheel, sharing a common hue and creating a harmonious, cohesive, and visually pleasing design
- these palettes are inherently beautiful and blend well and are good for things like navigation bars, a logo and its backgroundand the body of a website
- they offer low contrast, so it's common practice to introduce a neutral color like white or black to improve readability and help elements stand out
- to ensure content is legible and key elements pop, pair your analogous palette with a neutral color, such as white or black
- add more depth and interest to the scheme without high contrast, use different tints (lighter versions) and shades (darker versions) of the analogous colors
- carefully choose colors to ensure sufficient contrast, especially for text and interactive elements, to prevent the design from feeling too flat or subtle

# Complementary/Clashing color palette(good of you want something to pop)
- Colors opposite each other on the wheel, used for strong contrast and visual impact
- good for logos or icons
- do not use for text and text background
