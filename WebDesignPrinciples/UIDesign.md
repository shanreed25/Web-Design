# UI Design
## Hierarchy
- Color: different color for important things
- Size: bigger items draw your eyes to it to it

## Layout
- create more intrest by creating text with pictures and different sizes, shapes and hierarchies to make design more interesting
- line length, if to long it can be tedious to read and to short feels a bit to choppy and awkward to read
    - aim for 40 to 60 characters per line, or six or seven words

## Alignment
- the position of elements to each other
- reduce the number of alignment points, identify a line that goes down through the beginning of each item

## White Space
- inject whipe space and space things out

## Design For your Audience
- most things in your design depends on your audience
